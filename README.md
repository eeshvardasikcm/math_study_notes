# khan_academy_math_study_notes (beta) 0.3.0
<p>This C++ repository has some code I wrote during my studies of the Khan Academy Class 10(OD) course.
Some of the material covered in this course will certainly help my C++ templates, and also help me score higher on my <a href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/70a154e089698866b393f458447036523367585">EeshvarDasIKCM Codingame profile</a>.
This C++ CMake project uses C++17, and should not include any code from C++20 or newer for some time.</p>

## eeshvardasikcm (EeshvarDasIKCM)
<p>While restarting Khan Academy again today, it became obvious to me that I want to learn the Class 10(OD) mathematics course.
Before having time to look up exactly what a Class 10(OD) is, naturally I started with the course challenge.
This course is extremely interesting to me.</p>
<p>I scored a perfect 4.0 in first year Calculus in college, but then I stopped right there.
It will be nice to catch up on some geometry and trigonometry during this course.
Finishing my BS in Computer Science would be a major accomplishment for me and I am excited that Khan Academy offers this Class 10(OD) course in mathematics.</p>

## command line menu <b>enhancement</b> for 0.2.0
- add a quit option to allow menu to repeat again after one selection.
- [open for discussion](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/khan_academy_math_study_notes/discussions/5#discussion-6139780)
  - minor version 0.3 and 0.4
- based from this one [previous discussion topic](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/khan_academy_math_study_notes/discussions/5#discussion-6139780) posted: 
  - <b><i>cos 2x</b></i> will likely be menu item 12, or 2 on a separate trig menu;  
  - <b><i>cos 3x</b></i> will likely be menu item 12, or 3 on the separate menu;  

## approaching Class 10 (OD) using C++17
<p>Researching [Class (set theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)), led me to become slightly aware of its uses in mathematics.
The C++17 library does appear to contain sufficient classes that can help to approach the some of the calculations that are necessary for solving some problems on my Khana Acadamy Class 10 (OD) course.
These math study notes of mine are a combined effort to advance my education, and to improve my skills in coding C++.</p>

### patch 1
<p>patch will introduce some new device capabilities that will not affect user features.
These new device capabilities are a necessary part of bringing these study notes up to date with Math Class 9 (OD) mathematics.
The intent is to make changes to only the measurement unit part of the code to avoid disrupting the current working minor version.</p>
